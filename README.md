# JARVIS - Voice Assistant with Gemini LLM

A voice-controlled AI assistant inspired by Iron Man's JARVIS, powered by Google's Gemini LLM for advanced conversational capabilities.

## Features

- **Voice Recognition**: Listens to and processes voice commands
- **Text-to-Speech**: Responds with natural-sounding speech
- **Intent Classification**: Uses a trained neural network model to classify user intents
- **Gemini LLM Integration**: Leverages Google's Gemini LLM for advanced conversational abilities
- **System Controls**: Control volume, open/close applications, and more
- **Web Browsing**: Open websites and perform searches
- **System Monitoring**: Check system conditions like battery and CPU usage

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up Gemini API key**
   - Rename `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Add your Gemini API key to the `.env` file
   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
   ```
   - You can get a Gemini API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)

4. **Run the assistant**
   ```
   python jarvis.py
   ```
